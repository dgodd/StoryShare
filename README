This is a basic Rails 3.2 app with Devise and Omniauth configured for authenticating with Facebook
and Twitter.

The Devise templates are converted to HAML and use Twitter Bootstrap 1.4.
Included sass-twitter-bootstrap from https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap in vendor/assets.

The configuration for the Facebook and Twitter apps are stored in config/omniauth_providers.yml
The format of the file is the following:

facebook:
  scope: email # global setting for all environments
  test:
    app_id: the "application ID" of the Facebook app you use for testing
    secret_key: the "secret key" of the Facebook app you use for testing
  development: ...
    app_id: the "application ID" of the Facebook app you use for development
    secret_key: the "secret key" of the Facebook app you use for development
  production: 
    app_id: ...
    secret_key: ...
  # whatever other environments you have 
twitter:
  test: 
    consumer_key: the "consumer key" for the Twitter app you use for testing
    consumer_secret: the "consumer secret" for the Twitter app you use for testing
